const factorial = (num) => num === 1 ? num : num * factorial(num - 1)
// The main idea is that a recursive function will continue to call itself
// until the base case is satisfied.
// In this specific case, the facotrial function would still work if you set the base case to
// any number less than or equal to 2 instead of 1 because multiplying by 1 in our last call to our factorial function
// is unnecessary since anything times 1 is just itself.
// So doing this would essentially stop our factorial function from being called with the value 1 as num
// which is better for larger inputs

// Another example of recursion is the fibonacci series.
// Problem: Given a number N return the index value of the Fibonacci sequence, where the sequence is:
// 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...
// that the pattern of the sequence is that each value is the sum of the 2 previous values,
// that means that for N=5 â†’ 2+3 or in maths: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

const fibonacci = (num) => {
  if (num <= 1) {
    return 1
  }
  const solution = fibonacci(num - 1) + fibonacci(num - 2)
  console.log(solution)
  return solution
}

console.log(fibonacci(8))
